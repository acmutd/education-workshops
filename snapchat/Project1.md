##  Countdown Template (Tutorial)
The goal of this project is to familiarize ourselves with the basic workflow of Lens Studio.

Begin by opening lens studio after it completes installation.
- On PC it will be on your desktop or start menu labeled as `Lens Studio.exe`
- On Mac it will be in your applications folder or launchpad labeled as `Lens Studio`

At the top of the starting window of Lens Studio we will find the `Help` drop down and select `Start Tutorial` opening the countdown template tutorial.

Wait a few moments for the project to load.

 1. Select the `My Birthday Controller` object located in the top-left panel [Objects Panel]
 2. Customize the parameters of the `MyBirthdayController` script how you would like. This includes setting the countdown date, text shown under the countdown, and colors.
 3. Click the `+` button on the top left of the objects panel and add a `Face Stretch` object.
 4. Modify the face stretch hoever you would like within the center panel [Scene Panel].
 5. If you have a webcam that Lens Studio detects, switch to it in the top-left of the Preview Panel.
 6. Test the effect using your webcam! Try opening your mouth.
 7. Publish the effect using the `Publish Lens` button on the top left.
		 - This will require you to login to snapchat, if you do not wish to publish the lens simply close the web browser window after the upload completes and push `Done`.
8. Done! Return to home by clicking `Back to Home`.
