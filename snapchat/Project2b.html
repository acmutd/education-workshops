<p>Now comes the fun part, customization.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <code>Baseball Cap Controller [Edit Me]</code> Object in the Objects panel (Top-left). You should now see a variety of options in the Inspector panel.</li>
<li>First we will change our Baseball cap logo by either uploading our own image to resources or using GIPHY.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>To upload your own image, simply follow the steps above for importing the asset prefab, but instead use your own image file. Most image formats are accepted but keep in mind lenses have a 4MB size cap.</li>
<li>To use GIPHY we will select the <code>+</code> on the top left of the Resources panel (Bottom-left), then select the paper icon next to the search bar. This will open the GIPHY search panel. Once you find a GIF you like, click the <code>+</code> sign at the bottom of it and select <code>Add as Resource</code>.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Once we have our image resource ready we will click the box that says <code>yay</code> next to <code>Logo Texture</code> within the <code>Baseball Cap Controller</code> in the Inspector panel to select our new image resource. If your image is not in the correct place on the cap we can change its offset and size by moving the sliders below.</li>
<li>Next customize the rest of the settings in <code>Baseball Cap Controller</code> to your preference.</li>
<li>We will now turn our attention to the <code>Segmentation Controller</code> and select it at the bottom of the Objects panel (Top-left).</li>
<li>Following the same process as Steps 2-4 we will reuse or find a new image for the background to replace the <code>Image Texture</code> which is currently <code>heart</code>.</li>
<li>After setting our <code>Image Texture</code> of the (segmented) background we will modify the rest of the available settings in the inspector to our liking.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="testing-the-lens">Testing The Lens</h2>
<p>[This section is only applicable if you have a mobile device with snapchat installed.]
Now we will pair our Snapchat to our Lens Studio so we can preview our lens before we upload it publicly.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <code>Preview in Snapchat</code> on the top right of Lens Studio.</li>
<li>Scan the Snapcode displayed on screen like a QR code in Snapchat.</li>
<li>Push <code>Pair</code> on the prompt that displays after scanning the Snapcode.</li>
<li>Wait a few moments for the devices to pair, then click <code>Send Lens to Device</code> once it appears where <code>Preview in Snapchat</code> used to be.</li>
<li>Once it says <code>Lens Sent</code> open the Lens Carousel by tapping the small emoji face near the shutter button.

<li>Scroll to the right until you find your preview lens.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="done">Done!</h2>
<p>Publish the lens to your Snapchat account if you would like by clicking <code>Publish Lens</code> at the top-left of Lens Studio, then following the prompts on the website. Make sure you give it a new name and logo in <code>Project Info</code> before you upload.</p>
