## Segmenation Template  
The goal of this project is to familiarize ourselves with importing our own assets into existing projects/templates and using the asset library built into Lens Studio.  
  
## Importing Assets  
Begin by opening lens studio or returning to Lens Studio home with `CTRL+W` or `CMD+W`.  
  
Download the asset(s) above and put them somewhere safe for later use.  
  
At the top-center of Lens Studio home, we will search `Segmentation` and select `Segmentation`.

Wait a few moments for the project to load.  
  
1. We begin this project by importing our `Project 2 Cap Prefab.oprfb` asset we downloaded earlier.  
- Drag & drop the file into the Resources Panel [Bottom-left]  
- Or select the `+` in the Resources Panel and select `+ From Files` at the bottom of the dropdown. Then navigate to the asset we want to import.  
2. Wait a few moments for the prefab to load you will know it is done when a resource named `Project 2 Cap Prefab` appears (Shown below).

3. We will next drag the `Project 2 Cap Prefab` from resources into the object panel, placing it inside of the `Blue Camera` object. This will instantiate the Baseball cap object with everything we need to modify it.

4. Next click the small arrows on the left of the `Blue Camera` object we just placed our Baseball cap in to expand that Object's hierarchy, do it again for the `Project 2 Cap Prefab`.  
- This is what your project should be looking like so far: ![Project after Baseball cap import & Object exxpansion](https://i.imgur.com/aIeccrG.png)
